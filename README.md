# Progrramming_Patterns_Final-Project

# Project Description

## 1. Basic Description

This is a ***group project for up to two students***, though it can also be completed individually. If done in a team, both members must actively contribute to the project, and the same project files must be submitted by both students. A demonstration may be required at the end of the semester.

## 2.  Learning Objectives

* Develop a software product that meets user requirements.
* Design a database for storing data.
* Build a database client in Java using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).
* Implement CRUD operations within a Java application using JDBC
* Manage and manipulate data entered by the user, keeping track of changes.
* Create an internationalized application using I18N and L10N concepts along with relevant Java classes.
* Apply design patterns learned in class and implement an MVC architecture.
* Utilize data structures, collections, and Stream processing (with Lambda expressions).
* Collaborate through a Git repository for version control, issue tracking, and team collaboration.
* Follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## 3. Tools to be used

1. Any preferred IDE for development.
2. SQLite for the database.
   
## 4. Design Requirements

* A clear and well-designed GUI for input and output is essential.
* Utilize relevant class libraries.
* Implement at least two design patterns introduced in the class, such as Factory, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Bridge, Memento.
* Ensure the application follows MVC architecture.
* The application must support at least two languages (e.g., French and English), using I18N Java classes like ResourceBundle and Locale.
* Choose appropriate data structures that best fit the data model.
* At least two hierarchies of classes, each one has two layers (such as User, Teacher, Student) is required for the project. 

## 5. Steps to follow

~~1. Create UML diagrams (ER, class, and activity diagrams).~~
2. Create and populate the database.
3. Design the user interface (GUI or Console).
~~4. Implement the MVC architecture.~~
5. Develop the core classes.
6. Write test class(es) using JUnit to test the controller methods. 
8. Verify if CRUD operations implemented by the methods correctly update the database.
9. Add internationalization features using at least two Locale objects.
10. Refactor the code to incorporate design patterns.

## 10. Detailed Example: Library Management System

### 10.1 Introduction

The Limited Library Management System (LLMS) is a small-scale application where librarians can add books to the catalog, issue and return books, view the catalog, and see a list of issued books. To issue a book, the librarian verifies the studentâ€™s roll number and checks the bookâ€™s availability. After issuing, the bookâ€™s information is updated in the database. Books can be searched by title, author, or publication year.

### 10.2 Functional Requirements
The system provides different services based on the user type (Student or Librarian).

1. Librarian
    1. Add a book to the catalog
    2. Issue a book
    3. Return a book
    4. View the catalog (issued and available books)
    5. View the list of issued books and the students who borrowed them.
2. Student
    1. Search books by title
    2. Search by author.
    3. Search by publication year.
    4. View the catalogue (issued and available books)
    5. Borrow a book
    6. Return a book

### 10.3 Database Structure

You can create the following tables using SQLite or write a method in your application to create and populate the tables.

1. Books table:

    ``` sql
    | SN | Title | Author | Publisher | Quantity | Issued | AddedDate |
    ```

    * `SN`: Serial Number, TEXT, primary key.
    * `Title`: Book title (cannot be`NULL`).
    * `Author`: Authorâ€™s name (cannot be`NULL`).
    * `Publisher`: Book publisher (cannot be `NULL`).
    * `Quantity`: Number of copies available.
    * `Issued`: Number of issued copies (initially set to `0`).
    * `addedDate`: Date the book was added to the catalog.
    
2. Students table:

    ```
    | StudentId | Name | Contact |
    ```

    * `StudentId`: Student roll number, primary key.
    * `Name`: Student's name
    * `Contact`: student's contact number

3. IssuedBooks table

    ``` sql
    | id | SN | StId | StName | StudentContact | IssueDate |
    ```
    * `id`: Primary key (auto-increment).
    * `SN`: Book serial number (foreign key).
    * `StId`: Student ID (foreign key).
    * `StName`: Student's name.
    * `StudentContact`: Student's contact number.
    * `IssueDate`: Date the book was issued.

### 10.4 Implementation Details

1. Methods specifications
    1. `addBook(Book)`: Adds a new book to the catalog by creating an entry in the Books table, setting the `â€œIssuedâ€` attribute to zero, and recording the current date as the addedDate.
	2. `issueBook(b: Book, s: Student)` and `borrow(b: Book)`: These methods are responsible for issuing a book to a student. First, student details are verified. If the book is available (i.e., the `â€œIssuedâ€` value is greater than `0` in the Books table), the number of available copies (Quantity) is decreased by one, and the number of issued copies (Issued) is increased by one. A new record is then created in the IssuedBooks table. Both methods return true if the book is successfully issued.
	3. `returnBook(b: Book, s: Student)` and `return(b: Book)`: These methods handle the return of books. After verifying the studentâ€™s ID, the number of available copies is increased by one, and the number of issued copies is decreased by one. The corresponding entry in the IssuedBooks table is removed. Both methods return true if the book is successfully returned.
	4. `viewCatalog()`: Retrieves and returns a map of all books from the Books table. The mapâ€™s key is the bookâ€™s serial number (SN), and all books are sorted by `SN`.
	5. `viewIssuedBooks()`: Fetches all data from the IssuedBooks table and returns it as a sorted list by `SN`.
	6. `Search` Methods: These methods retrieve records from the Books table that meet specific search criteria, such as by title, author, or year of publication. The results are returned as a sorted list by `SN`.
